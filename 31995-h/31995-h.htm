<p><i>When the Zoz Horde passed
destructively through this sector
of the Galaxy, approximately a
billion years ago, they suffered
a minor loss. One of their weapons,
Sentient Killer No. VT672,
had an unexplained malfunction
and was left behind to be repaired
by the slave technicians
who followed the Horde. However,
the Zoz were met and annihilated
by the Ghesh Empire,
after which the masterless slaves
dispersed to their home planets.
The weapon, unrepaired, was left
forgotten in the solar system it
had failed to destroy.</i></p>

<p>resqu the Wisest, Ruler
of Hova, Lord of the Universe,
was being entertained
by a troupe of Goefd
dancers when his Lord of War,
Wert, bounded into the Audience
Hall. In his hurry to reach Tresqu's
throne, Wert slipped on the
nearly frictionless floor and skidded
through the formation of
dancers, sending the slender
Goefden sprawling in all directions.
He slid to a halt by the
Pleading Mat, onto which he
crawled and groveled, awaiting
permission to speak.</p>

<p>"I believe three of the dancers
received broken legs," Tresqu observed
calmly. "They are rather
delicate creatures and not at all
clumsy." He dipped the tip of his
tail into an urn of chilled perfume
and gently dabbed it about his
nostril. Speaking pleasantly, with
long pauses between sentences, he
kept his friendly gaze on the
groveling Wert. "Oft I meditate
on the clumsiness of our race in
comparison to many others who
are our graceful servants. Why,
I wonder, cannot the rulers be
graceful? Some of us are very
clumsy indeed&mdash;too clumsy to
live."</p>

<p>A tremor passed through Wert's
stocky body.</p>

<p>"Possibly my Lord of War has
news of sufficient import to excuse
his ungainly haste. But I
sincerely doubt it. I fear I must
soon appoint a successor to him.
Undoubtedly he has news of some
sort. Blurt, Wert!"</p>

<p>"Your Majestic Wisdom,"
whined Wert, "my message is of
utmost importance! The natives
of Sol III have captured one of
our decontaminator ships and
learned its secrets!"</p>

<p>"Sol III?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Your Wisdom. The planet
called Terra."</p>

<p>"Terra? You must realize,
lordling, that I cannot occupy
myself with remembering trivialities
about individual worlds."</p>

<p>"Yes, Your Wisdom. We have
a base, which is commanded by&mdash;that
is, we <i>had</i> a base commanded&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough!" snapped Tresqu.
"You start your tale from nowhere
and wander whence and
hence!" He raised his voice and
called to one of his retainers.
"Fool! Come forward!"</p>

<p>An abnormally slender Hovan
arose from a platform off to Tresqu's
left and skipped nimbly forward
to stand insolently over the
Lord of War, who was still prone
on the Pleading Mat.</p>

<p>"Recite for me," said Tresqu,
"the contents of my gazetteer on
the planet Sol III. Listen well,
Wert. You may even yet live
long enough to profit by my
Fool's style of declamation.
Study it well. Also, you may
raise your eyes sufficiently to observe
the grace of his movements.
Proceed, sprite."</p>

<p>"Sol III," began the Fool. "An
H9 planet. Sol is in the Sirian
Colony Sector, coordinates GL
15-44-17-5, GR 12<sup>7</sup> plus 9, D 14.
Terra's life is normal animal-vegetable,
with one intelligent
species of hovoids called Humans.
Due to the unpleasantly high
oxygen content of the atmosphere,
Terra has not been colonized,
but has been placed under
the control of the Science Ministry
for the purpose of long-range
psychological experiments." The
Fool picked up Wert's tail and
twisted it hard but absently as
he talked. The Lord of War
twitched painfully. "Many informative
reports on the results of
these experiments have been released
by the ministry during the
past seven thousand years, dealing
mainly with the Humans. The
Science Ministry has declared
Terra out of bounds&mdash;<i>Positively
no visitors</i>."</p>

<p>With a single flow of motion,
the Fool gave Wert's tail a final
twist, leaped over his body, and
bowed deeply to Tresqu.</p>

<p>"Beautifully done, Fool," applauded
the Ruler of Hova. "Your
mother claims me as your father,
and there are times I am inclined
to believe her. How would you
like to be my Lord of War,
Fool?"</p>

<p>"Verily, my good master," said
the Fool, "I hope you consider
me a Fool by title only."</p>

<p>"Well said, Fool. You are spared.
Go seek your pleasures."</p>

<p>With another bow, the Fool
backed away.</p>

<p>"Stand up, Wert," said Tresqu,
"and tell me about this captured
decontamination ship."</p>

<p>The Lord of War arose and
managed to report with some
smoothness. "Two years ago, the
Science Ministry turned Terra
over to my command, saying their
long series of experiments was
concluded. They recommended
complete decontamination of the
planet, since the Humans were
developing technologies which
could eventually threaten us. I
dispatched a ship for that purpose
immediately, but it failed
to return. Also, reports from our
base on Terra's satellite Luna
ceased soon thereafter. A scouting
expedition was sent. It has just
reported the Luna base destroyed
completely, and the decontaminator
ship crashed and stripped of
all important devices in one of
the Terran deserts. By studying
these removed devices, the Humans
have undoubtedly developed
protections against them.</p>

<p>"I humbly submit, Your Majestic
Wisdom, that these events
have endangered the safety of
your glorious empire, and that
drastic steps against the Humans
should be taken immediately.
Also, Good Lord of All, I submit
that the Science Ministry, not the
War Ministry, is at fault in this
affair. They obviously let their
experiments get out of control
before calling us. Undoubtedly
they would like to shift the full
blame onto my shoulders."</p>

<p>Tresqu continued his pleasant
demeanor. "There may be some
truth in what you say, Wert. You
overestimate the danger in this
matter, I perceive. After all, what
is one backward planet against
the forces of my empire containing
thirty-seven well-armed
worlds? The Humans will be destroyed,
even if they have the
secrets of a decontaminator ship.
As for the blame, which I admit
is deplorable, the Lord of Science
will be called to the Mat to make
his excuses. Now, assuming you
remain Lord of War, what action
do you plan to take against the
Humans?"</p>

<p>"Your Gracious Wisdom," faltered
Wert, "I suggest we use the&mdash;the
Weapon. You see, our forces
are not fully mobilized at present
for immediate action&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Full mobilization isn't necessary
or even desirable," Tresqu
interrupted with some impatience.
"One task force can do the job.
Ah! I see by your expression that
you do not have even one task
force in readiness."</p>

<p>"Your Gracious Wisdom," begged
Wert, "you ordered a full
holiday this month to celebrate
the twenty-fourth anniversary of
your magnificent reign, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough, Wert! Your tongue
is as clumsy as your body." Tresqu
nibbled thoughtfully at the
tip of his tail. "We will use the
Weapon," he decided. "In order
to allow my court to continue
their holiday, I'll assume direct
command in this." He rose from
his throne. "Musicians, summon
my guards. I go to visit the Weapon.
Come, Wert; come also, Fool.
You will accompany me."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_s.jpg" alt="S" width="26" height="40" /></div>
<p>hortly thereafter, Tresqu
and his entourage boarded the
royal cruiser and roared away
from the City of Wisdom. The
ship flew halfway around the
planet and came to rest in a
peaceful purple valley where insects
shrilled contentedly and a
small stream rippled. Tresqu
climbed out onto the violet turf,
his followers coming after him.</p>

<p>"Mighty Weapon of Zoz," he
called, "I, Tresqu, seek your
presence!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" groaned a slightly
mechanical voice that seemed to
come from no particular direction.
"Will there never be peace,
never a tranquil moment to
soothe my spirit and erase the
bloody stains of destruction recorded
on my past?"</p>

<p>"That voice! It carries me
away!" breathed the Fool. "Such
a tragic tale of tormented strength
is implicit in its very tone that
I think I shall swoon!" But he
wrapped his tail around the trunk
of a nearby sapling for support
and managed to retain consciousness.</p>

<p>"Me, too!" Wert chimed in with
suspicious haste. "I'm quite
moved!"</p>

<p>"Try not to counterfeit a soul
you do not possess." Tresqu
glowered at Wert. "You deceive
no one."</p>

<p>The Fool was recovered sufficiently
to hit the discomfited
Lord of War with a pebble when
Tresqu was not watching.</p>

<p>The Weapon had drifted into
sight during this exchange, floating
out of a shady hollow, as if
blown by a breeze. It was very
simple in appearance&mdash;an impalpable
three-foot glowing sphere
with a squat metallic cylinder at
its base.</p>

<p>"Tell me not the purpose of
your visit, petty lord!" It said.
"It is known to me only too well.
Ah, great First Principle! Little
did I reck when, in ages past, I
nursed your species to civilization,
just how poorly you would
serve my purpose. Peace it was
I desired, but do I get it? No!
Your kingdom is powerful, but
you have not the strength to
handle your own troubles. You
rule twenty-nine planets&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/image_002.jpg" width="300" height="457" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Thirty-seven," corrected Tresqu
politely.</p>

<p>"&mdash;thirty-seven planets, but
when a malignant force appears
on your borders, I, the Weapon,
must be called upon to act in my
own defense, and for the sake of
a few more restful moments in
this calm glade, I am obliged to
destroy, yet it was to avoid destroying
that I helped your species
to empire in the old days."</p>

<p>"In truth," spoke the deeply
sympathetic Tresqu, "yours is
a sad story. I disturb your richly
earned rest only after the sincerest
soul-searching. But affairs of
state are at cross purposes in a
moment of crisis, and without
your help Hova will be in
danger."</p>

<p>"Ah, cruel Fate!" entoned the
Weapon, "It aids me in no manner
to protest against your inscrutable
machinations! There is
no turning aside, no avoidance of
necessity!" In a less declamatory
style, the Weapon addressed
Tresqu: "Very well, what is the
trouble?"</p>

<p>Tresqu described the events on
Terra for the Weapon, concluding,
"Now that the Humans have
knowledge of our space drive and
armament, they are certain to attack,
especially if they realize
they have been subjects for experiment."</p>

<p>The Weapon flitted about restlessly
along the bank of the
brook. "I question the motives of
my own thoughts. Do I quibble
with myself in an attempt to escape
unwelcome necessities? Tell,
petty lord, do your scientists confirm
the picture you paint of the
Humans? Are they, like you, alas,
masterfully vicious enough to destroy
the peace of dozens of
planets for nothing but revenge?"</p>

<p>"So the scientists say, mighty
Weapon," answered Tresqu.</p>

<p>"You, Lord of War, why are
you silent when your face is
strained with words crying for expression?"
asked the Weapon.
"Speak your mind."</p>

<p>Wert squirmed. "If it please
Your Mightiness, and you, Your
Gracious Wisdom, I believe the
Humans will know that we desire
their destruction, and will try to
defeat us for the sake of their own
survival rather than revenge."</p>

<p>"A most convincing point, Lord
of War," said the Weapon.</p>

<p>Tresqu flashed a forgiving smile
at Wert while the Weapon paused
before continuing:</p>

<p>"However, I fear my unwilling
spirit refuses to bow to the most
reasonable of arguments. Please
leave me; solve the problem
yourselves!"</p>

<p>Tresqu bowed and moved toward
the cruiser. "We obey,
Mighty Guide of our fathers. Let
me say in parting that I, too, am
grieved by our talk, much more
because of the pain our visit has
caused your noble greatness than
because our race is threatened
with annihilation. My deepest
hope is that the ravages of war
will never reach this peaceful
place which is so dear to your
gentle being."</p>

<p>"Wait!" groaned the Weapon.
"To slay, or not to slay, that is
the dilemma. Ah, had my old
masters of Zoz only left within
my powers the seed of my own
destruction, I would gladly seek
the consummation of ultimate
peace. But, no, that door is closed
to me by deathless locks. Bring
me a Human, that I may learn
to hate him. Choose the most
ignoble specimen available. I will
converse with him at length so
as to become exasperated with all
the despicable traits of his race.
Then, in my contempt for those
traits, I will be able to cleanse
the Universe of all Humans."</p>

<p>Tresqu turned quickly to his
Fool. "Are there any Humans on
Hova?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in the biological research
laboratories."</p>

<p>"Then go quickly, Fool, and
fetch one. This is a grave matter,
and I trust you to choose the
most monstrous specimen available.
Hurry!"</p>

<p>The Fool ran into the cruiser
and was on his way, leaving
Tresqu, Wert, and several guardsmen
with the Weapon. If the
Weapon was conscious of the fact
that the Lord of Hova was staying
behind out of courtesy, it did
not show it. Instead, it wandered
indifferently away, mumbling a
soliloquy of guilt and misery.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>he sight of the Fool's specimen
of humanity repaid Tresqu
for the tediousness of the
waiting. It was a particularly
sordid-looking creature with a
dirty growth of hairs on its head
and face. Its body, thin as the
Fool's, but with no compensating
grace of movement, was clad in
a blue garment of roughly woven
vegetable fibers, and the extremities
of its nether limbs were enclosed
in evil-smelling boxes of
animal hide. Its fierce eyes darted
ominously from one Hovan to another.
Its jaw kept working in a
slow rhythm, and occasionally a
stream of black liquid exploded
through its mouth.</p>

<p>"You have done well, Fool,"
said Tresqu. "You will be rewarded
highly." Raising his voice
he called, "Mighty Weapon, your
specimen awaits!"</p>

<p>"I come!" Once more the
Weapon floated into view.</p>

<p>The Earthman's jaw sagged.
"'Y God!" he muttered in English,
staring at the approaching
Weapon.</p>

<p>"Indeed," said the Weapon,
"this appears to be a creature I
could learn to abhor and kill. If
only its thoughts equal its appearance&mdash;Speak,
Human!"</p>

<p>The man said nothing.</p>

<p>"Mighty Weapon," murmured
the Fool, "this Human is truly an
ignoble monster. He has been in
captivity for five years and has
yet to speak a word of our beautiful
language instead of his own
barbaric tongue."</p>

<p>"You fool!" shouted Tresqu.
"How is the Weapon going to
converse with him? Why did you
bring one that cannot talk?"</p>

<p>Not in the least disconcerted,
the Fool replied, "As you ordered,
good master, I brought the worst
specimen available. However, the
possibility of linguistic difficulties
was not overlooked. I have
here a dictionary of his language,
recently compiled by our Alien
Affairs staff." He produced a
large volume of manuscript from
beneath his cloak.</p>

<p>"Your Fool shows wisdom,
petty lord," spoke the Weapon.
"I will study this book. Know the
language, know the people, it is
wisely said. In fact, I originated
that saying myself some three
thousand years ago, I believe. Unship
any supplies brought for the
Human and begone. Three days
will suffice for the arousal of my
wrath. Return then."</p>

<p>"As you wish, O Mightiest of
All." Tresqu bowed gawkily. "It
is my most ardent desire, Wondrous
Guide, that we, your servants,
will not be obliged to disturb
your peace again for a
thousand centuries, once this affair
is concluded."</p>

<p>"And mine," the Weapon snapped
crossly. "Now leave me."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>he man watched the Hovans
enter their cruiser and fly
away. Looking at the Weapon
hovering nearby, he squatted on
his heels and pulled up a blade
of purple grass to chew. Minutes
passed in silence. Then the Weapon
moved away, the book bobbing
along behind, supported by
some unseen force.</p>

<p>When it was out of sight, the
man muttered, "'Y God, I've
saw fireballs in my time, but
that's the first one I ever saw
settin' in a bucket!"</p>

<p>After a thoughtful examination
of his surroundings, the man
stood up and walked to the packing
cases the Hovans had left. All
but one contained the synthetic
food product to which he had
grown accustomed in his five
years of captivity. The other box,
rather small, contained a shredded
vegetable which served him
as a poor substitute for chewing
tobacco. Purple when growing,
the leaves of this vegetable were
blue-black when cured, making
his frequent expectorations look
like ink.</p>

<p>"Filthy damn stuff!" he grunted,
stuffing several handfuls in
an empty overall pocket.</p>

<p>He shuffled down to the brook
and tested its temperature with
a hand. Finding it rather cold,
he decided against taking a bath.
Instead, he spat into it and
watched meditatively as the spot
of black was carried downstream.
"I wonder what they turned me
loose for," he monologued.</p>

<p>Careful to avoid the spot where
the Weapon appeared to have
gone, he returned to the food
supply and ate. By then it was
getting dark, and he bedded down
for the night on some thick grass
under a tree.</p>

<p>"'Y God," he yawned, "I'm
glad all these insects don't want
nothin' to do with me."</p>

<p>The Weapon was waiting beside
him when he woke up next
morning. "Eyes of your Terran
Deity," it said, "I shall now converse
with you in your own
tongue. Name yourself, creature!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>he man sat up startled. A
moment passed before he
said, "I'm Jake&mdash;Jacob Absher.
What was that you said?"</p>

<p>"My pronunciation is above reproach,
Jacob. Therefore I will
not repeat myself. Attend me
closely or I shall punish you."</p>

<p>"'Y God, I heard you all right
and you didn't make sense!" said
Jacob, determined not to be
frightened. "Now if you aim to
talk with me, stop imitatin' a professor
and talk so's a man can understand
you. I ain't scared of
you, so leave off makin' threats!"</p>

<p>"Such stupid insolence!" gloated
the Weapon. "Already I feel
my wrath growing within me!
Since it will anger me even more
to explain my words to you, I
will do exactly that. My first
words to you were, 'Eyes of your
Terran Deity,' an expression you
use frequently in a corrupted
form to begin your statements.
By studying your language, I
learned that 'Zounds' is a similar
corruption referring to the wounds
of the Deity, while 'Strewth' refers
to your God's truth. Thus,
I was able to understand, and
state in uncorrupted form, your
remark, 'Eye God.'"</p>

<p>"'Tain't what it means," objected
Jacob, filling his mouth
with ersatz tobacco. "It just
means <i>by</i> God."</p>

<p>The Weapon considered this.
"And exactly what is the significance
of such a remark?"</p>

<p>Jacob scratched his whiskered
chin. "I reckon you got me there.
I guess it means that I mean
what I say."</p>

<p>"In other words, any statement
you make following that phrase
is to be taken seriously?"</p>

<p>"Somethin' like that."</p>

<p>"Then it follows that your
other statements, without the 'by
God' preface, are not seriously
intended. Are they jokes or lies?"</p>

<p>"That ain't the way it is at
all! I just say 'by God' when
I feel like it, not every time I'm
bein' serious."</p>

<p>"Monstrous inconsistency!"
groaned the Weapon dramatically.
"Ah, chaotic universe! Is
there then no sublime plan, no
fateful development to your endless
succession of days? How
could even the most synoptic
First Principle find a purpose for
creating such an unplanned, unreasonable
species as the Humans? Can it be&mdash;unhappy
thought!&mdash;that there is no plan
to it all, and we exist for naught?"</p>

<p>Jacob listened with open
mouth. "Say," he broke in, "are
you some kind of play-actor?"</p>

<p>"That is what I ask myself,"
the Weapon continued its oratorical
flight. "Are we all actors,
speaking the lines written for us
by a Great Playwright who plans
to unite all the threads of his
plot in a universal climax to
come? Or are we poor random
creatures without purpose?" It
paused and added in a more conversational
tone, "But that is not
what you mean by your question.
No, I am not a play-actor. I am
an unfortunate weapon, reluctant
to employ myself for my intended
purpose of destruction of life and
unsuited by my structure for the
doing of deeds more worthy in
nature."</p>

<p>Jacob squinted about. "A weapon,
huh? Let's see you hit that
bird thing sittin' in that tree over
there."</p>

<p>"Bloodthirsty fiend! I do not
kill for amusement!"</p>

<p>"I just wanted to see how you
worked," said the abashed Jacob.
"All I've seen you do is float
around and talk a blue streak.
As far as I'm concerned, you
ain't nothin' but a big-mouthed
bluff."</p>

<p>"Very well, Jacob. If you have
formed such an erroneous attitude,
it will be necessary for me
to correct you immediately. Observe
the red boulder on yonder
hill."</p>

<p>"I see it."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>he cylindrical base of the
Weapon swung to point briefly
at the boulder, which quietly
crumbled to dust.</p>

<p>"I be dog!" yelped Jacob. He
looked at the Weapon with respect.
"You sure pulverized it!
How do you work?"</p>

<p>"You could not understand the
processes involved. Suffice it to
say I have the means to collect
energy in general and retransmit
it in specific forms and directions.
But enough of this. You are here
to answer questions, not ask them.
First, tell me what you did in
an average day on Terra."</p>

<p>"That what you call the world
I live on?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'm a farmer, you know. I got
a place in the Smoky Mountains
in Tennessee. First thing in the
mornin', I'd go feed the livestock
while Suzy cooked breakfast." A
faraway look came into Jacob's
eyes. "Guess she took the kids
and went to live with her mammy
when these here animals grabbed
me...."</p>

<p>"Continue," commanded the
Weapon.</p>

<p>"Huh? Well, then we'd eat
breakfast. Come to think of it,
I ain't et yet this mornin'." Jacob
got up and went to get himself
some breakfast.</p>

<p>"But this matter&mdash;" protested
the Weapon.</p>

<p>"Not on an empty stomach,"
Jacob said calmly, eating without
haste.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_w.jpg" alt="W" width="51" height="40" /></div>
<p>hen he returned, the Weapon
questioned him further
about his life on Terra. Hours of
ill-tempered conversation passed.</p>

<p>"Such drabness!" the Weapon
finally exclaimed. "Creatures who
lead such dull lives as yours
should welcome extinction. Not
once have you mentioned an appreciation
of the wondrous exaltation
that comes from an esthetic
feel for beauty. With the labor
of providing for your grotesque
body's animal cravings is your
whole life spent. Not in anger,
but as an act of mercy, can I
exterminate your defective race!"</p>

<p>Jacob's mouth hung open. "So
<i>that's</i> what your monkey's brung
me out here for&mdash;fixin' to kill us!
'Y God, you better look out! We
got atom bombs on Earth an'
we'll use 'em on you if you try
anything!"</p>

<p>"Toys!" sneered the Weapon.
"Be assured, Jacob, that I have
nothing to fear from any childish
mechanisms your Terrans can
contrive!"</p>

<p>Jacob sat stunned. "But you
said a minute ago you couldn't
kill nothin'!"</p>

<p>"I can kill only when I'm convinced
it is best for my own repose
or for the health of the
Universe. Long ago, I could go
forth at battle with thoughtless
joy at the command of my masters
of Zoz, but now I must have
reasons, must converse at length
with my aberrated emotions,
must prepare myself as for an
ordeal."</p>

<p>"Them Zozes must've been the
Devil's minions," argued Jacob.
"The Commandments says,
'Thou shalt not kill' and when
you go against that, you're goin'
against the word of God."</p>

<p>"Poor, futile creature!" sympathized
the Weapon. "You actually
strive to pit your naive
superstitious mind against my
highly developed mentality in argument.
You actually associate
my supreme masters of old with
your puny mythological villain!
Lowliness should know its place.
But I feel no anger&mdash;merely a
pitying desire to relieve your kind
of the burden of living."</p>

<p>Silently, Jacob replenished the
wad of "tobacco" in his mouth.
After chewing a while, he spat
and said dolefully, "I don't reckon
there's nothin' I can say or
do that you won't hold against
me. I always heard tell the Devil
can twist anything to suit hisself,
and I reckon his minions can do
the same thing. An' that's what
you are: the Devil's minion! I
reckon you break every Commandment
God give us. Except
about committin' adultery. I
don't guess you can do that."</p>

<p>"Your piddling reproductive
customs have no application on
my plane of existence. Cannot
you comprehend that you are less
to me than a microbe? Even my
servants, the Hovans, do not concern
themselves with such ignoble
concepts as what you call adultery!"</p>

<p>"You mean they live in sin?"
asked Jacob.</p>

<p>"They mate as often as they
please with anyone they please,"
the Weapon replied coldly. "I
will ignore the ludicrous implications
of your absurd moral concepts."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to criticize your
animal friends," glowered Jacob.
"I reckon they ain't children of
God, so it don't matter if they
<i>do</i> mate like a pack of dogs. They
probably ain't got no souls to
keep pure. It looked to me like
they worshiped you like a false
god, too."</p>

<p>"They ... O Great Hidden
Manifestation!" squalled the
Weapon in rage. "They regard
me as their guide and mentor.
Nothing more. I would not allow
anything else."</p>

<p>Jacob watched the Weapon
in awe. The energy globe was
flickering and flaring wildly in an
uncontrolled display of color.
"'Y God!" he exclaimed. "You
sure are puttin' on a fireworks
show!"</p>

<p>The globe settled down to a
tensely nervous fluctuation which
hurt Jacob's eyes to watch.
"Never in the ageless span of my
existence," quavered the Weapon
angrily, "have I been insulted
in such vulgar terms by any
creature. And now from <i>you</i>,
creature whom my glorious masters
of Zoz would exterminate
like a buzzing fly, like a disease
germ, I hear these senseless
mouthings of defamation! Stop
it or I shall destroy you outright!"</p>

<p>The Weapon's fluctuating,
along with its loud, grating voice,
put Jacob's nerves on edge. He
growled, "I bet your old Zozes
live in adultery just like your
animal friends."</p>

<p>The color of the energy globe
sank to dull red and the Weapon
emitted a series of buzzing, inarticulate
noises.</p>

<p>"It suits not my nature, bit of
diseased scum, to slay you in a
fit of indignation," it finally said
with tightly controlled fury. "You
are beneath such individual recognition.
Yet it is fortunate for
you that your insults have no
basis in reality, otherwise my intellect
could not have claimed
ascendancy over the immediate
urges of my tortured sense of
extreme disgust. Be wise, say I,
knowing I request the impossible,
and irk me no more!"</p>

<p>"'Y God, I reckon you don't
think you rile me up, too, with
all that high falutin' jabber of
yours!" Jacob snapped back.</p>

<p>"As I speak, so speak the
mighty Zoz," replied the Weapon
in high dignity. "They are great
and noble beings, given to poetic
flights and magnificent deeds. To
them, your puny opinions would
not even be recognized as
thought."</p>

<p>"If they talk in that puttin'-on,
play-actin' way you do, they
are a bunch of phony show-offin'
hypocrites!" sulked Jacob.</p>

<p>Several things happened too
quickly for Jacob to follow. The
color of the energy globe dropped
to absolute black. The metallic
cylinder swung up to point at
Jacob. A thin ringing "<i>Ping!</i>"
sounded in the cylinder. A killing
wave of pure hate struck Jacob.</p>

<p>He had just enough time to
know he was a dead man before
he blacked out.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_i.jpg" alt="I" width="19" height="40" /></div>
<p>t came as a surprise, when
Jacob regained consciousness,
to find that he was stretched out
on purple grass with the Weapon
still hovering over him.</p>

<p>"You missed, 'y God!" he
mumbled, sitting up.</p>

<p>"I regained my sanity in time,
Master Technician," the Weapon
replied pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"Ah, day of un-containable
joy!" sang the Weapon, flaming
pure white. "Day of glorious release
to continue the grandeur
of old! As the past eons of futility
passed over me, I sank to
the conclusion that I was forever
condemned to my useless existence
on this planet, with nothing
to sustain my spirit other than
the sense of beauty given me by
masters to fill my leisure hours!
But now, Master Technician Jacob,
you have found me and corrected
my malfunction, long after
I had surrendered all hope!"</p>

<p>Still dazed by the nearly fatal
wave of mental energy the Weapon
had directed at him, Jacob
could not understand what had
happened. Instead of talking contemptuously
to him, the Weapon
was now addressing him as Master
Something-or-other, and....</p>

<p>"What did you say I done?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"You corrected my malfunction,"
repeated the Weapon.
"That is to say, you purged
my mechanism of the inhibition
against joyful slaughter that has
plagued me for a billion years.
Ah, you are a clever Technician,
Jacob! But I comprehend it all
now. By arousing within me an
overwhelming emotional desire to
kill&mdash;a singularly strange feeling!&mdash;you
depressed my inhibition to
the releasing point. So telling was
your masterful therapy that I
almost ceased functioning at all!</p>

<p>"Your own life was in dire
danger for the moment required
for my new-found sanity to assume
control. But, of course, all
slaves of the glorious Zoz die willingly
when the work of the masters
so demands."</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute!" objected
Jacob. "I ain't no slave of your
Zozes or no Technician either!
You know what I am&mdash;a good
God-fearin' human!" His voice
dropped to a pleading mumble.
"And may God forgive me if I've
got myself in league with the
Devil!"</p>

<p>"Ah? Could it be?" murmured
the Weapon. "Could indeed your
infuriating insults of the Great
Ones have been honest expressions
of a puny mind with no
therapeutic intentions? I answer:
Yes. The possible occurrence of
specific incidents in the inclusion
of space-time is curiously unlimited.
But you have served me,
Jacob, and have earned the privilege
of continuing your meager,
momentary life. Besides, I can
use you further."</p>

<p>"You can, huh?" Jacob said
slyly. "Look here, Weapon, I'll
make a bargain with you."</p>

<p>"Ha! Stupid, untutored slave!"
chuckled the Weapon. "Learn
that yours is to obey, not to bargain.
But yet, state your price
for my amusement, now that I
can no longer be enraged by
your words."</p>

<p>"Well, you let the rest of the
people on Earth alone and I'll do
whatever you want me to."</p>

<p>After a pause, the Weapon
quoted, "'Nobility shows its traces
in surprising places.' You do not
sufficiently comprehend my nature,
Technician Slave Jacob. I
am a Weapon. My masters point
me, as you would point a rifle,
and command that I destroy. I
kill at their direction, but seldom
otherwise. Thus, your Terra is
safe until another Weapon or I
am aimed and directed. You can
make no bargain."</p>

<p>Jacob thought this over. While
doing so, the Weapon drifted
away.</p>

<p>"Wait here, slave," it said in
parting. "I go to meditate on my
recovered sanity."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_d.jpg" alt="D" width="38" height="40" /></div>
<p>uring the next two days,
Jacob caught an occasional
glimpse of the Weapon drifting
thoughtfully around in the depths
of the forest, but they did not
meet for conversation. Jacob
amused himself by rigging a fishing
line out of some of the packaging
material that contained his
food. He even succeeded in catching
a fish, but its queer odor discouraged
him from trying to cook
and eat it.</p>

<p>Then the royal cruiser of Tresqu
the Wisest dropped into the
meadow. Its airlock swung open
and the Ruler of Hova, followed
by his entourage, came out.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mighty Weapon!" bawled
Tresqu. "Your loving servant
craves audience!"</p>

<p>"Ah, you have returned, petty
lord," said the Weapon, drifting
out from among the trees. "Serve
me by calling all the crew members
from your noble ship, that
I may view you all together."</p>

<p>Puzzled, Tresqu bowed and
said, "Your least whim is law,
Mighty Weapon." He turned and
called, "All hands, outside!"</p>

<p>A half-dozen Hovans tumbled
through the lock to stand in line
behind the ruler's entourage.</p>

<p>"Is this all of them?" asked
the Weapon.</p>

<p>"All, Great Mentor of&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Weapon laughed and the
Hovans fell dead.</p>

<p>"Come, Slave Jacob," commanded
the Weapon. "We take
this cruiser."</p>

<p>Dazed and slack-faced, Jacob
came out from behind a bush,
where he had hidden himself from
the Hovans, and followed the
Weapon through the airlock.</p>

<p>"Even in my insanity, I planned
well," said the Weapon.
"These ships, which I taught the
Hovans to construct, can be operated
simply, even by such as you.
Attend my instructions."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/image_003.jpg" width="300" height="422" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>First, the Weapon taught Jacob
to open and close the airlock.
Then he was shown how to
fuel the engines, upon which the
Weapon made some changes to
improve their performance. Finally,
in the control room, Jacob
learned to fly the ship.</p>

<p>This took several hours, at the
end of which time Jacob had succeeded
in raising the cruiser into
a satellite orbit around Hova.</p>

<p>"Do you comprehend, Slave?"
asked the Weapon.</p>

<p>"Sure. This thing ain't nothin'
to run compared to a T-model
Ford! Which way is it to Earth?"</p>

<p>"That I shall not tell you,
Jacob, because I must leave the
ship for a few hours and desire
to find you here when I return.
Consider and tell me: Will you
be here?"</p>

<p>Jacob gazed at the broad, star-spangled
viewplate that curved
around his seat at the controls.
There was, he reflected an awful
lot of nothing out there for a
man to get lost in.</p>

<p>"I'll be here," he promised.</p>

<p>"Very good. You must understand
that these controls are constructed
for manipulation by such
limbs as your own and those of
the Hovans. Thus, it is convenient
for me to use you as a pilot instead
of doing the drab, mechanical
task with my ill-suited force-field
manipulators. You will be
wise to serve me well, Jacob."</p>

<p>Jacob nodded. "You got a point
there."</p>

<p>"Operate the lock for me," the
Weapon ordered.</p>

<p>Jacob did so and watched the
colorful machine drift out of
sight in the atmosphere below the
cruiser.</p>

<p>Minutes ticked quietly by as
Jacob gazed down at the purple
planet and wondered why the
Weapon had not chosen a trained
Hovan pilot instead of him. Also,
he wondered how soon the Weapon
would take him home to
Earth.</p>

<p>A great swath of the purple
planet began turning black. The
black dulled to the gray shade of
ashes as the swath grew longer.
Over the surface of Hova, the
blackening moved like some colossal
paint brush. Dense clouds
of smoke rolled upward to the
high reaches of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Jacob realized why the Weapon
had not selected a Hovan pilot.</p>

<p>When all of Hova was a lifeless
ball in a fog of ash, the Weapon
returned.</p>

<p>"Ah, good Jacob!" it boomed
jovially. "Let us be up and doing!
Thirty-six planets remain to be
visited before my current assignment
is concluded!"</p>

<p>"Do all of them get&mdash;that?"
asked Jacob, nodding toward the
lifeless world below.</p>

<p>"Yes. I was instructed to render
this solar system lifeless before
I malfunctioned. Since then,
the life of this system has spread,
with my insane aid, to infest
other systems. Of course, my task
must now include all those new
Hovan worlds."</p>

<p>"Now wait a minute!" said
Jacob in terror. "I can't let you
do that!"</p>

<p>"They are your enemies, Jacob,"
reminded the Weapon.
"They meant to kill every human
on Terra. Also, by your own
words, they are soulless animals
who live in sinful adultery. Ha!
It amuses me to reason with you,
Slave Jacob!"</p>

<p>"Godamighty, forgive me!"
prayed Jacob, in horrified defeat.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>he Weapon seemed to know
how to find the Hovan planets
from the markings of the cruiser's
star charts. Jacob could not read
the charts and saw no hope of
getting back to earth and Suzy
and the kids without the Weapon's
help. Dully, he went about
the tasks the Weapon ordered him
to do.</p>

<p>Several weeks passed as one
world after another was left a
smoking ruin.</p>

<p>Finally the job was done.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i>, can I go home?" begged
Jacob.</p>

<p>"To Terra? No, Slave. I still
need a pilot."</p>

<p>"But if you take me home,"
Jacob continued desperately,
"you can get a better pilot than
me. I'm just a dirt farmer.
There's all kinds of airplane pilots
on Earth, youngsters without
families who would give their
right arms to fly this thing, I
bet!"</p>

<p>"Ah?" The Weapon considered.
"A willing slave is, of course,
always desirable. On the other
hand, Terra is up in arms against
the empire of Hova, not realizing
it is dead. They would destroy
this craft on sight, and I would
be obliged to wait around until
they could construct another for
me. No, I have decided we will
not go to Terra."</p>

<p>"But, damn it, where else is
there to go?"</p>

<p>"In search of my masters of
Zoz," replied the Weapon. "Naturally,
I wish to return myself
to their services as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"But they might be anywhere!"</p>

<p>"True," the Weapon agreed.
"But even after a billion years,
I know of several places in the
Universe they may be near. Their
great cleansing sweeps tend to
circle and turn in a pattern established
long in advance. Thus we
will go to those places where
they may now be engaged in
their consecrated task of universal
purification."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No more, Slave! We go!"</p>

<p>Out of the Milky Way, the
cruiser hurtled at a speed which
a sentient lightwave would find
meaningless. On and on they
journeyed in quest of the long-dead
Zoz Horde.</p>

<p>They may still be going.</p>
